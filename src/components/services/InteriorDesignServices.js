        <p>Neoclassical is one of the trendy design styles chosen by many wealthy customers.</p>
        <p>Like recalling the golden age, neoclassical "pulls" people to slow down and enjoy more. This is also the way NaDu wants to bring customers the emotions they must have when living in their home: relax, unwind and get rid of all the tiredness of the world out there.</p>

        </div>
        <p>NaDu neoclassical apartment has achieved a more open design thanks to the extremely new creations of NaDu architects. The interior used in the apartment has been displayed in a sharp way, maintaining the principles of neoclassical style but no longer complicated.</p>
        <div className='imgser'>
          <img className=" lazyloaded" alt="Gam màu mà NaDu lựa chọn cho phòng khách là màu nâu của sàn gỗ" width="850" height="607" data-src="https://nadudesign.com/uploads/images/tknt/thiet-ke-thi-cong-noi-that-01.jpg" src="https://nadudesign.com/uploads/images/tknt/thiet-ke-thi-cong-noi-that-01.jpg"/>
        </div>
        <p>The color scheme that NaDu chose for the living room is the brown color of the wooden floor, the gray color of the sofa combined with white wall paint as the main color. The harmonious combination of these colors creates a rare, luxurious and elegant overall look.</p>
        <div className='imgser'>
          <img src="https://nadudesign.com/uploads/images/Thi%E1%BA%BFt%20k%E1%BA%BF%20n%E1%BB%99i%20th%E1%BA%A5t/Thi%E1%BA%BFt%20k%E1%BA%BF%20n%E1%BB%99i%20th%E1%BA%A5t%20nh%C3%A0%20ph%E1%BB%91/thiet-ke-noi-that-hien-dai-03.jpg" alt="" width="850" height="567"/>
        </div>
        <p>The highlight of the room is the sofa with an arc that makes the space more interesting and new. Neoclassical style combined with modernity has given the apartment a new color and vitality that is rarely found in today's mass designs.</p>
        <div className='imgser'>
        <img className=" lazyloaded" alt="thiet-ke-noi-that-11" width="850" height="607" data-src="https://nadudesign.com/uploads/images/tknt/thiet-ke-thi-cong-noi-that-08.jpg" src="https://nadudesign.com/uploads/images/tknt/thiet-ke-thi-cong-noi-that-08.jpg"/>
        </div>
        <p>The bedroom has a bed made from wood and high-quality felt fabric, dark brown as the central highlight for the entire room. Glass wall cabinets link the space and make the whole look luxurious.</p>
        <p><b>Minimalist style</b></p>
        <p><b>Area:</b>Suitable for all types of housing areas today</p>
        <p><b>Funding:</b>Investment funding is consistent with the homeowner's budget</p>
        <p><b>Interior materials:</b>Often use An Cuong industrial wood, artificial stone, metal surfaces, and high-quality leather.</p>
        <p><b>Color:</b>Minimalist style usually only uses 3 colors at most: a background color, a main color, and an accent color. Neutral colors are often used in wall panels to create a stepping stone for all colors inside.</p>
        <p>Minimalist style in architecture is a way of taking "less and doing more". Therefore, architects NaDu often focus on the value of creating space instead of having to "cram" furniture into the apartment. In this minimalist apartment, space is the factor that creates emotions.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The minimalist apartment design that NaDu has implemented not only simply brings the beauty of an architectural style but also represents the homeowner's lifestyle.</p>

        </div>
        <p>That is the image of people who, after a period of being infatuated with intricate and intricate patterns, seek beauty in simplicity.</p>
        <p>These are people who have to come into contact with so many people every day and face a terrible workload, but an airy space filled with light is what they are aiming for.</p>
